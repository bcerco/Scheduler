<h1>Viewing &amp; Editing Scheduler Source Code</h1>

<h2>Java</h2>

<p>You will need Java 8 installed on your system in order to run the Scheduler.  Depending on your operating system, 
you may also need additional packages for JavaFX.  We recommend using a pre-built Eclipse package instead, see below.</p>

<h2>Eclipse</h2>

<p>Since the Scheduler uses JavaFX, you will need to use a particular version of Eclipse.  You could add JavaFX libraries
to the current Eclipse that you have.  As stated above, however, we recommend using a pre-built package.  The Eclipse package
that we used can be found <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html">here</a>.

<br><br>Once you have your Eclipse set up, you can import the Scheduler project into it and start editing.<br></p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>The Scheduler source code is split into two main parts, the front end and the back end.  The front end is responsible 
for the GUI and interaction with the user.  The back end is reponsible for reading/writing files and mainting all the 
neccessary class information in memory.
<br>The front end code is located here:<br>
<br><code>../Scheduler/Schedule Manager/src/SchedulerManager</code><br>
<br>The back end code is located here:<br>
<br><code>../Scheduler/Schedule Manager/src/Class</code><br></p>
